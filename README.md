#üìå Exercises Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sum of Digits in a Number

A program that repeatedly asks the user for an integer and calculates the sum of its digits. It continues running until the user enters a negative number. The program extracts each digit using modulus and division operations inside a while loop.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Grade Classification (with Loop)

A program that classifies student grades based on numerical input (0-100). It assigns letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) using if-else statements and continues allowing multiple inputs until a negative number is entered.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse String Using Loop

A program that takes a string input and reverses it using a loop. It iterates through the string from the last character to the first and constructs a new reversed string.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Count Vowels and Consonants

A program that takes a string input and counts the number of vowels and consonants. It ignores non-alphabetic characters and iterates through the string using a loop, identifying vowels and consonants using conditional statements.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Check for a Specific Character in a String

A program that checks whether a given character exists within a string. The user provides a string and a character to search for. A loop iterates through the string to determine if the character is present and prints an appropriate message
